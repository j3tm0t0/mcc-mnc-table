# mcc-mnc-table
**This repository is no longer maintained.**

Mobile Country Codes (MCC) and Mobile Network Codes (MNC) table in CSV, JSON and XML. Updated daily.

The table is pulled from http://mcc-mnc.com/.

# Contributing
Pull requests for the code (.py files) are welcome.

I do not accept any pull requests that directly modify the tables (.csv, .json and .xml files) in any way, as they are automatically generated by the Python scripts.

# Updates (April 2025)

The scripts have been updated to improve reliability and ease of use:

1. **BeautifulSoup Integration**: Replaced regex-based HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup for more robust handling of website structure changes.

2. **Dependencies Management**: Added `requirements.txt` file for easier dependency installation:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Automated Update Script**: Added `update-mcc-mnc-tables.sh` shell script to update all tables at once:
   ```
   ./update-mcc-mnc-tables.sh
   ```
   This script checks for dependencies, updates all three formats (CSV, JSON, XML), and provides status messages.

These changes make the scripts more resilient to website structure changes and easier to maintain going forward.
